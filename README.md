# alexa-rail-info

"Rail Info" Alexa Skill provides a variety of railway stats such as a list of cancelled trains, rescheduled trains and ticket status based on the unique PNR number.
With over 150+ trains rescheduled/cancelled each day in India, the skill gives a count of trains cancelled/rescheduled. However, info for the 1st 5 in the list is shared over voice output.
For checking the PNR status, a valid PNR number (for Indian Railway) trains is required. Do let me know if you want me to share a valid one for test purpose.
Phase 2 of the skill will have more interactions for cancelled/rescheduled trains. Also, with improved architecture, I plan to have more options added like seat availability, trains running between locations and a lot more.

# Invoke And Use

Some sample utterances, to get the information from this skill
1. Alexa launch rail info and give me the list of cancelled trains
2. Alexa launch rail info and give me the lis of cancelled train
3. Alexa launch rail info and give me the status for the PNR Number <Your PNR number>

# Adv

With Railways being a most used mode of transport in India, this skills acts a boon to get list of cancelled/rescheduled trains and PNR status info on the go, instead of the browser or app dependency to check the status time and again. The skill will be enhanced further for more interactions and information like fare, seat availability, trains running between locations and a lot more.
